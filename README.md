# Max Flow Problems

This is a repository for a course project (IT251: Data Structures and Algorithms - II)  

In this, we explore various solutions to the [Maximum Flow Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem). These are :-

- Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
- Edmonds-Karp Algorithm
- Dinic's Algorithm
- Push-Relabel Algorithm

More importantly, we explore two applications of the max-flow problem:

- The Gomory-Hu Tree
- Analysis of an underground tunnel network with escape routes, to determine the most efficient way to prevent escape.

# Running the program

- Ensure you have Python3 installed.
- Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Mohit-Mithra/IT251-DSA-miniproject.git```
- Change directory to the source folder: ```cd IT251-DSA-miniproject/src/```
- Run the program: ```python3 main.py```
